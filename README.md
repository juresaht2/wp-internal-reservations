# Wordpress internal reservations

Wordpress plugin with a reservation calendar (to replace SharePint).

## Project status

This is an open sourced production component, the internal development of which has been discontinued.

It is provided in the hopes that it will be useful and perhaps expanded upon, but a lot of functionality may at this point be hardcoded for our particular purpose.

## Roadmap

Things which could be added.

### Convert / publish on Wordpress Plugins

### Merge multiple calendars

Add a view that allows multiple calendars to be viewed as one.

If a reservation is made, provide the option for the user to choose which callendar to make it to.
